There are millions of possible colours and gradient combination but we are hardly able to explore even a fraction of it. There was a need for something which can make us explore every possibility of colours and gradients. With this thought, <span className="gradient-text">Random Gradients</span> was born.</p>
              <p className="uk-text-left"> <span className="gradient-text">Random Gradients</span>  gives a designer a freedom to explore an infinite possibility of colours and gradients. It also enables them to save random gradients for further use in their design. </p>
