              <p className="uk-text-left">It started with an obsession for colours and gradients. There are millions of colours and possible gradient combination but we are not able to even explore 10% of them. There was a need for something which can make us explore every possibility of colours and gradients. With this thought, <span className="gradient-text">Random Gradients</span> was born.</p>
              <p className="uk-text-left"> <span className="gradient-text">Random Gradients</span>  gives a designer possibility to explore infinite no. of a possibility of colours and gradients and even save them for further use in their design. </p>
